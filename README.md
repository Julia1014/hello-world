# hello-world
hello world! This is my first class repository. I'm excited to learn about git and GitHub 

## about me
I am currently a third-year Business Economics major with a minor in **Data Science**! I started getting more into data science after taking an introductory course with Professor Voytek in my first year, and since then I've developed a passionate interest in data analysis and coding. In the future, I hope to learn from real-world data science applications through potential research and internships. 

### interests

1. crochet
2. draw & paint
3. meal prep
